                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monday 11th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Introduction to the module. On this day we learnt more about what to do for each assignment and how the format of the lessons was going to work from then on. We looked online for inspiration for our new website which was very helpful and during the photography lesson, we learnt more about cameras and how to work with them.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I will apply the inspiration that I got from looking at other live websites onto my own, making sure that I still use my ideas for it. I will also use the skills that I learnt during the photography lesson throughout this module as one of the assignments includes being familiar with cameras and taking 5 pictures which, I then will post on my website.</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tuesday 12th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the first part of the morning, we created our own GitHub and Atom accounts and learnt how to use them alongside each other to make our website. We pushed our first versions of our websites to the internet and made the first changes to the themes we chose. During the photography lesson we learnt things such as rule of thirds, fill the frame and other techniques.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using Atom and GitHub at the same time is a skill that will be of extreme importance throughout the module as this is what allows us to make changes to it and making them live. Different photography techniques are what will allow us to take different and interesting photos which will give us better grades when we submit our portfolios.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wednesday 13th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This digital Wednesday&rsquo;s activity was to read the Dieter Rams Design Principles presentation, choose one of the principles, find two apps/websites that demonstrate the principle and why, share your link, findings and thoughts in a group Teams conversation.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This activity gave us further inspiration for our website which we will use in the future.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thursday 14th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On this day we learnt more about linking pages within the website and how to edit the navigation bar which made a huge difference to the website as it all is now coming together. As well as this, during photography lesson, we learnt more about different genres which were inspiring for when we take our pictures for the assignment.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Linking pages is essential in website building. Without it, the website would be incomplete so by learning this I built a skill that I will most certainly use in the future as I develop my website further.</span></p>

                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friday 15th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today I was absent due to illness but during class, everyone learnt more about changing fonts on their websites and how to change colours. There was no time for photography on this day due to a TTC presentation.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing fonts and colours will allow me to personalise my website further and make it look the way I want it to.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Week 2</span></strong></p>

                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monday 18th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today during the morning we made more changes to our website with the help of Christine who looked at our work individually and taught us how to put extra content on our website that we wanted to put in it. On the second part of the morning, we looked at a website from Canon which taught us more about aperture, depth of field, light, among other things.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Canon&rsquo;s website gives a better idea of what the difference between the camera settings is. We got to change the settings and automatically find out how each changes the picture in their way.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tuesday 19th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today we learnt how to insert images onto our website using unsplash&rsquo;s free photos. I chose all black and white pictures which fit with the theme of my website. During the second part of the lesson, we watched a video which taught us more about the difference between RAW and JPEG images and briefly learnt more about photo editing on photoshop.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inserting images changes the website completely as it allows me to develop the theme that I was going for which is everything in black and white. This will be very helpful in the future when I need to upload my pictures and videos to the website.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wednesday 20th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today&rsquo;s digital Wednesday activity included reading three guides which talked about dealing with files and HTML and CSS basics. After that, we had to write on the collaborative glossary and work on our design log.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This activity gave us a better idea of how to work with HTML and CSS which is essential for future website building.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thursday 21st November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today I made essential changes to my website which included changing fonts to all lowercase and change the accent colours of the website which is now a deep burgundy. During the second part of the morning, we went into town to take pictures for our portfolio.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I was able to change things that I did not do last week due to my absence. This allowed me to personalise my website further.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friday 22nd November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today we spent the morning finishing our prototype website and our design logs.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Finishing the prototype website and design logs in time for the deadline will allow me to get a good grade.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Week 3</span></strong></p>

                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Monday 25th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today we learnt more about colour theory and how It affects the mood of people looking at the website and how colours can tell the viewer what the brand represents. For example, purple=royalty. We also did an activity in groups which required us to name things that made us think of a certain colour. During the last part of the lesson, we learnt about capturing and editing audio as well as where to keep sound levels when to record and how to set up microphones. This was very useful because we will need these skills to complete the assignment for this module.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Colour theory will be implemented on my website and my pictures as I want both to represent certain qualities. Audio recording is a skill that I learnt about previously but today I got to improve on it which will be very useful in the future.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tuesday 26th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today we learnt about what HTML and CSS are which is very important for website building and designing. The lecture was very interesting to me as this was very confusing to me before today. After our break, we learnt more about how to interview people and how to make the interview interesting for the viewer. This was very important as we will need to conduct an interview for the audio part of our assignment, and I want to make mine as interesting and grasping as I can.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Learning about interview techniques is a skill that I will need in the future so furthering this skill is essential. I have conducted interviews in the past but I feel more prepared to do so as of today.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wednesday 27th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During today&rsquo;s lesson, I inserted code snippets onto my photography website for it to look more organised and different from other pages. During the second part of the lesson, I edited the audio interview.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inserting code snippets will help me make sure that all my pages on my website look different, This will show the assessors that I am capable of doing more intricate changes and that I have learnt a lot from theory lessons.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thursday 28th November</span></strong></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today we learnt how to embed our pictures on our websites by resizing them and saving them for web.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After the break, Bobbi and I recorded the audio interview required for the assignment</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Knowing how to resize and save a picture for web will be essential for the completion of the photography assignment of this module.</span></p>

                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today was very interesting because I learnt about something that I do not think about much as I do not need it but a big number of people do. How to make a website accessible is a massive part of web design and I intend to implement what I learnt today on my website. After the break, we did a video workshop with Lawrence which was to record an interview with a group and use single camera techniques which were explained.</span></p>
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I will use the skills I learnt today on my portfolio by writing alt text on all of the pictures on my website which will allow every viewer to enjoy it. I will also use single camera techniques that were taught today in the interview that I will record for my portfolio.</span></p>
