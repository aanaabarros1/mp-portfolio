<p><strong>Monday 11<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Introduction to the module. On this day we learnt more about what to do for each assignment and how the format of the lessons was going to work from then on. We looked online for inspiration for our new website which was very helpful and during the photography lesson we learnt more about cameras and how to work with them.</p>
<p>I will apply the inspiration that I got from looking at other live websites onto my own, making sure that I still use my own ideas for it. I will also use the skills that I learnt during the photography lesson throughout this module as one of the assignments includes being familiar to cameras and taking 5 pictures which, I then will post on my website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 12<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>During the first part of the morning we created our own GitHub and Atom accounts and learnt how to use them alongside each other in order to make our website. We pushed our first versions of our websites to the internet and made the first changes to the themes we chose. During the photography lesson we learnt things such as rule of thirds, fill the frame and other techniques.</p>
<p>Using Atom and GitHub at the same time is a skill that will be of extreme importance throughout the module as this is what allows us to make changes to it and making them live. Different photography techniques are what will allow us to take different and interesting photos which will give us better grades when we submit our portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 13<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>This digital Wednesday&rsquo;s activity was to read the Dieter Rams Design Principles presentation, choose one of the principles, find two apps/websites that demonstrate the principle and why, share your link, findings and thoughts in a group Teams conversation.</p>
<p>This activity gave us further inspiration for our website which we will use in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>On this day we learnt more about linking pages within the website and how to edit the navigation bar which made a huge difference to the website as it all is now coming together. As well as this, during photography lesson we learnt more about different genres which was inspiring for when we take our own pictures for the assignment.</p>
<p>Linking pages is essential in website building. Without it, the website would be incomplete so by learning this I built a skill that I will most certainly use in the future as I develop my website further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday 15<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today I was absent due to illness but during class everyone learnt more about changing fonts on their websites and how to change colours. There was no time for photography on this day due to a TTC presentation.</p>
<p>Changing fonts and colours will allow me to personalise my website further and really make it look the way I want it to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Week 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monday 18<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today during the morning we made more changes to our website with the help of Christine who looked at our work individually and taught us how to put extra content on our website that we wanted to put in it. On the second part of the morning we&nbsp; looked at a website from Canon which taught us more about aperture, depth of field, light, among other things.</p>
<p>Canon&rsquo;s website gives a better idea of what the difference between the camera settings are. We got to change the settings and automatically find out how each change the picture in their own way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 19<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we learnt how to insert images onto our website using unsplash&rsquo;s free photos. I chose all black and white pictures which really fit with the theme of my website. During the second part of the lesson we watched a video which taught us more about the difference between RAW and JPEG images and briefly learnt more about photo editing on photoshop.</p>
<p>Inserting images changes the website completely as it allows me to develop the theme that I was going for which is everything in black and white. This will be very helpful in the future when I need to upload my own pictures and videos to the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 20<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s digital Wednesday activity included reading three guides which talked about dealing with files and HTML and CSS basics. After that we had to write on the collaborative glossary and work on our design log.</p>
<p>This activity gave us a better idea of how to work with HTML and CSS which is essential for future website building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 21<sup>st</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today I made essential changes to my website which included changing fonts to all lowercase and change the accent colours of the website which is now a deep burgundy. During the second part of the morning we went into town to take pictures for our portfolio.</p>
<p>I was able to change things that I did not do last week due to my absence. This allowed me to personalise my website further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we spent the morning finishing our prototype website and our design logs.</p>
<p>Finishing the prototype website and design logs in time for the deadline will allow me to get a good grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Week 3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monday 25<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we learnt more about colour theory and how It affects the mood of people looking at the website and how colours can tell the viewer what the brand represents. For example: purple=royalty. We also did an activity in groups which required us to name things that made us think of a certain colour. During the last part of the lesson we learnt about capturing and editing audio as well as where to keep sound levels when to record and how to set up microphones. This was very useful because we will need these skills to complete the assignment for this module.</p>
<p>Colour theory will be implemented on my website and my pictures as I really want both to represent certain qualities. Audio recording is a skill that I learnt about previously but today I got to improve on it which will be very useful in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we learnt about what HTML and CSS is which is very important for website building and designing. The lecture was very interesting to me as this is something that was very confusing to me prior to today. After our break we learnt more about how to interview people and how to make the interview interesting for the viewer. This was very important as we will need to conduct an interview for the audio part of our assignment, and I want to make mine as interesting and grasping as I can.</p>
<p>Learning about interview techniques is a skill that I will need in the future so furthering this skill is essential. I have conducted interviews in the past but I feel more prepared to do so as of today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 27<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>During today&rsquo;s lesson I inserted code snippets onto my photography website in order for it to look more organised and different from other pages. During the second part of the lesson I edited the audio interview.</p>
<p>Inserting code snippets will help me make sure that all my pages on my website look different, This will show the assessors that I am capable of doing more intricate changes and that I have learnt a lot from theory lessons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 28<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>Today we learnt how to embed our pictures on our websites by resizing them and saving them for web.</p>
<p>After the break me and Bobbi recorded the audio interview required for the assignment</p>
<p>Knowing how to resize and save a picture for web will be essential for the completion of the photography assignment of this module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday 29<sup>th</sup> November</strong></p>
<p>uring today&rsquo;s lesson I inserted code snippets onto my photography website in order for it to look more organised and different from other pages.</p>
<p>During the second part of the lesson I edited the audio interview.</p>
<p>Inserting code snippets will help me make sure that all my pages on my website look different, This will show the assessors that I am capable of doing more intricate changes and that I have learnt a lot from theory lessons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Week 4</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monday 2<sup>nd</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today I was not absent but I worked from home on this design log by improving the quality of it and adding more detail.</p>
<p>Adding more detail to the design log is important for this assignment as it can improve my grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 3<sup>rd</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today was very interesting because I learnt about something that I do not think about much as I do not need it but a big number of people do. How to make a website accessible is a massive part of web design and I intend to implement what I learnt today on my website. After break we did a video workshop with Lawrence which was to record an interview with a group and use single camera techniques which were explained.</p>
<p>I will use the skills I learnt today on my portfolio by writing alt text on all of the pictures on my website which will allow every viewer to enjoy it. I will also use single camera techniques that were taught today in the interview that I will record for my portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 4<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s digital Wednesday activity included recording an audio log explaining what the progress of my website has been since the prototype version of it and complete an infographic about the subject discussed in my audio interview.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my progress allowed me to think how I can improve my website on time for the deadline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today I mainly worked on structuring the video interview and planning what camera angles I will be using. I also planned what equipment I will need ahead of the day of recording.</p>
<p>Being organised about recording the video will be important for when we film in order for things not to go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday 6<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today we worked on our assignments all day.</p>
<p>Adjusting certain aspects of my website to make it look as best as I can will improve my grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Week 5</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monday 9<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today we worked on our assignments all day. I worked from home as I was not feeling well.</p>
<p>Adjusting certain aspects of my website to make it look as best as I can will improve my grade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday 10<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s lesson I adjusted some final elements on my website in order to get everything ready for the deadline on Friday. <br />After the break we had a guest speaker coming in to talk to us about his career in journalism and PR. I learnt a lot about what career paths I can take in communications and how to get there.</p>
<p>Adjusting my website and finishing it is essential for me to finish the assignment on time on Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday 11<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>On today&rsquo;s digital Wednesday activity, we have to watch a talk on accessibility in technology and how it affects other people. After watching the talk, we must also answer questions about what we learnt from it.</p>
<p>Learning more about accessibility will push me to make my website more inclusive for every viewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today I worked on every aspect of my website by talking to Christine about aspects that I was not sure about. I also worked on my design log.</p>
<p>The last improvements will allow me to upload the assignment on time for tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Friday 13<sup>th</sup> December</strong></p>
<p>Today is the deadline day. I added alt text to all my pictures and added my infographic and audio log onto my website. This will allow me to hand in my work on time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>.</p>
